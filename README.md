# Planet Shooter

**Planet Shooter** is a simple, single-player browser-based shooter game where players click on planets to gain points. As the game progresses, objects drop faster, challenging the player's reflexes and precision.

## 🕹️ Gameplay

- The objective is to shoot (click) as many planets as possible.
- For every planet missed, your "miss count" increases.
- Every 3 planets missed will cause you to lose 1 life.
- A UFO resets the miss count, giving you a second chance.
- As time progresses, the planets and other objects will drop faster, increasing the difficulty.

## 🎮 Controls

- **Mouse Click**: Shoot planets by clicking on them.
- Avoid missing too many planets to stay in the game.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **WebGL**: For rendering game objects.
- **TypeScript**: The primary language for game logic.
- **Kaplay.js**: A game programming library.

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- **Mobile Support**: Planned for a future update to allow players to enjoy the game on mobile devices.
